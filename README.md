# Notify Web Application

## What is it

Notify is a note keeping and sharing web based application. Users can create different note groups which can either be for personal use or for a group of users. The user which creates the note group can add more users to the group, who will then have access to the different notes/tasks stored under the group.
Apart from this, users can update already existing note groups and delete them as well. Same goes with the notes/tasks present inside a particular group.
